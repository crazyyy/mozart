				<div class="title">About Play with Mozart</div>
				<p>Play with Mozart is live classical concert series geared toward babies and toddlers aged 0-5. <br>These concerts are designed for families with babies and toddlers as this is the age mostly not catered for by traditional concert halls.</p>
				<ul class="list-styling">
					<li>The music is carefully chosen to appeal to both babies and adults and performed by professional musicians, ranging from harpists and sopranos, to trumpeters and string trios.</li>
					<li>The concert hall is clean and absolutely safe, so everybody is required to take off the shoes before entering, and the play mats are strategically placed all around the hall.</li>
					<li>Children can dance, roam about, and listen to music the way they feel it. They can feed during the concert, get right up to the performers or have a crawl around (even crawl under the piano). They could interact with each other on play mats. The concerts are designed so that children can just be themselves.</li>
					<li>We don’t mind the babies making a bit of noise. Even your baby will cry aloud and you have to step out for some time, there is no issue in that! We will be happy to see you back with your smiling baby!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>With soft flooring and toys for the babies and coffee with cake for the adults, concerts don’t come more relaxed and baby-friendly than this! Adults and children can relax and share the enjoyment and pleasure of a fabulous live music experience together.</p>
				<p>Concerts last around 50 minutes.</p>
				<p>After the concert you will have some time to talk to the musicians as well as try to play theirs musical instruments.</p>

						<div class="title title-small">The unique duet of violinists "Kazanskie Brothers"</div>
						<p>Vigorous emotional direction of performances, communication with the audience, drive, vivid emotions, good mood, and, obviously, unlimited devotion to music contribute a lot to distinction of the style of this duet. Having begun their career more than 12 years ago in the Central School of Music by Moscow State Conservatory named after P. Tchaikovsky, these guys managed to preserve their attachment to the cause of violin.</p>
						<p>As they were honing their skills at Conservatory of Venice, living hand in hand with each other, Kazanskie brothers decided to perform together in the duet. "Due to our firm base we were able to perform at classical concerts and festivals, however, we felt that our potential contains something more than performance at a common concert hall. Therefore, we started to seek "our own music" and perform it elsewhere we could: in the streets, parks, places for those who are as young, vigorous, energetic, free from stereotypes as we are!" - these guys tell us. </p>
